# Contributing
We're happy to take contributions.  

We use [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) for our workflow practice.  

Fork the repository from `dev` (our current working branch) and put in a PR against `dev`, or request to be added to the É´á´œÊŸÊŸposters organization.  

Be sure to merge `dev` into your working branch regularly to avoid merge conflicts.  

Create a feature branch `feature/my-feature` based on `dev`, write your code, and create a pull request for `feature/my-feature` -> `dev`  

Bug fix branches should be created in a similar fashion, `bug/big-bad-bug` -> `dev`
